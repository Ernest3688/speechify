# speechify
A native android app to help people with Dysgraphia using to speech to text technology.
The Android build system compiles app resources and source code and packages them into APKs or Android App Bundles that you can test, deploy, sign, and distribute.

# The build process
The build process involves many tools and processes that convert your project into an Android Application Package (APK) or Android App Bundle (AAB).

The Android Gradle plugin does much of the build process for you, but it can be useful to understand certain aspects of the build process so you can adjust the build to meet your requirements.

Different projects may have different build goals. For example, the build for a third-party library produces AAR or JAR libraries. However, an app is the most common type of project, and the build for an app project produces a debug or release APK or AAB of your app that you can deploy, test, or release to external users.

This page focuses on app development, but many of the build steps and concepts are common to most build types.
